# What Still Needs to Be Done

Below is a short list of items that are **not yet done**. We will fix these so the system matches how you want to work.

---

## 1. When to send login credentials (SMS/email)

**Right now:** As soon as you add a tenant, the system sends their login credentials (SMS/email) automatically.

**What you asked for:** Do **not** send credentials when you only add a tenant. Send them only **after you create the lease**. At that point you should see an option like **“Send invitation”** so you can send when you are ready, or leave it as draft until then.

**We will:** Change it so credentials are sent only after the lease is created, with a clear “Send invitation” (or similar) button when you are ready.

---

## 2. Form titles: Individual, Company, Resident

**Right now:** When you add a person, the form does not always say clearly whether you are adding an “Individual tenant”, “Company tenant”, or “Resident”.

**What you asked for:** The form should clearly show:
- **“Individual tenant”** when you are adding an individual tenant  
- **“Company tenant”** when you are adding a company  
- **“Resident”** when you are adding a resident (not “Tenant” at the top)

**We will:** Update the labels so the form always matches what you are doing.

---

## 3. Why did “Create resident” fail?

**Right now:** When adding a resident fails, you only see something like “Failed to create” with no reason.

**What you asked for:** The system should tell you **why** it failed (for example: “This email is already in use”) so you know what to change.

**We will:** Show a clear, plain-English reason whenever resident creation fails.

---

## 4. Billable tenant dropdown: wrong or repeated text

**Right now:** When you choose the “billable tenant” for a resident, the dropdown sometimes shows the same text repeated (e.g. “Company One, Company One, Company”) or wrong text.

**What you asked for:** The dropdown should show the correct name once (e.g. “Company One”) with no duplication.

**We will:** Fix the dropdown so it shows the correct, clear label.

## 5. Choosing a resident when creating a bedroom lease

**Right now:** When you create a **bedroom lease**, the list of people you can select does **not** include residents. You cannot choose the resident for that lease.

**What you asked for:** You should be able to **select the resident** when creating a bedroom lease (either in the same list or a clear “Select resident” option).

**We will:** Add residents to the selection when creating a bedroom lease so you can assign the right person.

---

## 6. Sending messages in the app (Communication)

**Right now:** You receive SMS with credentials, but when you try to **send or reply to messages inside the app**, nothing appears to go through or show up.

**What you asked for:** When you send a message in the app, it should actually send and you should see it (and replies) in the conversation.

**We will:** Fix in-app messaging so sending and receiving works and is visible.

---

## 7. Where to send an email

**Right now:** There is a page that shows **email logs** (history of emails sent), but there is **no clear place to write and send a new email**.

**What you asked for:** A clear place to **compose and send an email** (e.g. a “Send email” or “Compose” button or screen).

**We will:** Add (or make easy to find) a way to compose and send an email from the system.

---

## 8. Using the same email for testing (optional)

**Right now:** You cannot use the same email for more than one tenant. That makes it harder to test or review the flow without real/different emails.

**What you asked for:** Some way to test the flow without having to use different real emails every time (e.g. test mode or guidance).

**We will:** Consider options (e.g. test mode or clearer instructions) so review and testing are easier. This is lower priority than the items above.

---

**Summary:** The items above are what we will address next. If you want to change the order of priority or add anything, tell us and we will adjust.
